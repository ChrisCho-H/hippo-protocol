![Welcome to the Hippo Protocol](images/cosmos-hub-image.jpg)

# Introduction

Hippo Protocol is a Cooperative Protocol for Healthcare Data Collection & Utilization powered by the interchain stack: [CometBFT](https://cometbft.com), [CosmosSDK](https://docs.cosmos.network) and [IBC](https://ibc.cosmos.network). The primary token of Hippo Protocol is the **HP**.

## The HP

Do you have HP tokens? With HP, you have the superpower to contribute to the security and governance of the Hippo Protocol. Delegate your HP to one or more of the validators on the Hippo Protocol blockchain to earn more HP through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your HP to influence the future of the Hippo Protocol through on-chain governance proposals.

Learn more about [being a delegator](./delegators/delegator-faq.md), learn about [the security risks](./delegators/delegator-security.md), and start participating with one of the following wallets.

Learn more about `hippod` with the [delegator's CLI guide](./delegators/delegator-guide-cli.md).

## Running a full-node on the Hippo Protocol Mainnet
